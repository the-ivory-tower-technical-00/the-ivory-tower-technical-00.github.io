# The Ivory Tower

# Welcome

Welcome to the ivory tower. The network provides access to various cloud services, IoT devices and game servers. To become part of the network, you have to install the tailscale overlay network client on your machine and join a Tailnet.
The ideal way to do this, is to receive an invite link via mail and use it to install Tailscale and authenticate with the network.

## Getting in touch

We only give access to people we know and trust personally. So if you have been directed to this site, you already have contact to one of our admins.
Congratulations, you have completed this first step already :)

## Connecting to the net

Click the invite link that you reeceived from one of our admins and follow the instructions on the page to install Tailscale.
Don't creeate any own network. If you aren't asked to join one after the installation, click the invite link you received again, and you should be prompted to join.

Tailscale is an overlay network provider, similar to for example ZeroTier, and works like a VPN but instead of connecting you to another machine, it connects you to a whole network of machines.
The network is hosted on @celeste-42bit's own private infrastructure, so be aware, that you have to trust them or your referrer in order to use this service. You will find our privacy statement and terms of service for the whole network on the main page of the cloud.

## Getting aproved

To add your device to the network, you need to be approved by an admin. Since you should alreeady be in contact with one of us, this shouldn't take long.

Approval entails allowlisting your device, so it is added to the list of devices on this network, and adding so called ACL's which are access control rules, allowing you to access certain machines or services within the network. The networks security and access posture is "deny by default", so you need specific approval by an admin for every machine you want to access (e.g. node0, node1, or the netmaster) or by a moderator for every service you want to access on one machine (e.g. a minecraft server or a Nextcloud instance on node1).

## Managing your connection

Tailscale on Windows 10 & 11 runs in the background. You can find it on the right side of your taskbar or hidden in that little arrow symbol on your taskbar. For reference, the icon is a grid of nine dots, some of which are illuminated. With this icon you can connect to or disconnect from the network, usually referred to as "The Tailnet". If some of the dots in the symbol are illuminated, prtraying the shape of a "T", you are connected. Otherwise just click the symbol and you'll connect to the network automagically. To disconnect, you need to right-click the symbol and hit the first list entry.

**For security and performance reasons, disconnect from the network whenever you're done accessing our services.**
